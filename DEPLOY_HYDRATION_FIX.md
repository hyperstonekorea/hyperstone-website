# Deploy Hydration Fix - Quick Guide

## What Was Fixed
- âœ… Hydration mismatch causing infinite loading
- âœ… Added production source maps for debugging
- âœ… Created error boundaries to catch runtime errors
- âœ… Fixed SSR issues with client components
- âœ… Improved error logging and recovery

## Deploy Now

### Step 1: Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve hydration mismatch and enable error boundaries"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Vercel Deployment
- Vercel will automatically deploy when you push to main
- Check https://vercel.com/dashboard for deployment status
- Wait for "Deployment Ready" status

### Step 3: Test Production Site
1. Visit https://www.hyperstone.co.kr/
2. Open DevTools (F12) â†’ Console tab
3. Verify:
   - âœ… Content loads (no infinite loading)
   - âœ… No errors in console
   - âœ… All sections display correctly
   - âœ… Navigation works

### Step 4: Check for Errors
If you see errors in console:
1. **Good News**: Source maps are enabled, so errors are readable
2. Copy the error message and stack trace
3. Check which component is failing
4. The error boundary should catch it and show a friendly message

## What to Expect

### Before Fix
- Infinite "Loading..." state
- Blank page or stuck loading
- Minified error messages
- No way to recover

### After Fix
- Content loads within 2-3 seconds
- Progressive loading of sections
- If error occurs: friendly error message with retry button
- Readable error messages in console

## Troubleshooting

### If Content Still Doesn't Load

1. **Check Console Errors**:
   ```
   Open DevTools â†’ Console
   Look for red error messages
   Copy the full stack trace
   ```

2. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   ```
   Go to Vercel Dashboard
   Click on your deployment
   Go to "Functions" tab
   Check for server-side errors
   ```

3. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   If it works locally but not on Vercel, it's likely an environment issue.

4. **Check Network Tab**:
   ```
   Open DevTools â†’ Network
   Look for failed requests (red)
   Check if API calls are failing
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Failed to fetch /api/admin/settings"
**Solution**: This is expected and handled. The site uses fallback configs.

#### Issue: Framer Motion errors
**Solution**: Already fixed with `ssr: false` in dynamic imports.

#### Issue: Hydration mismatch
**Solution**: Already fixed by removing mounted state check.

#### Issue: Blank page
**Solution**: Check error boundary - it should show an error message.

## Rollback (If Needed)

If the fix doesn't work:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Find the previous deployment (before this fix)
3. Click "..." menu â†’ "Promote to Production"
4. Site will revert to previous version

## Success Indicators

âœ… **Deployment succeeded**
- Vercel shows "Deployment Ready"
- No build errors

âœ… **Site loads**
- Homepage displays content
- No infinite loading state
- Sections appear progressively

âœ… **No console errors**
- Console is clean (or shows handled errors)
- Error boundaries work if errors occur

âœ… **Navigation works**

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Monitor for 24 hours**:
   - Check Vercel Analytics for error rates
   - Watch for user reports
   - Monitor console for new errors

2. **Test all features**:
   - Contact form
   - Product pages
   - Language switching
   - Mobile responsiveness

3. **Optimize further** (optional):
   - Add Sentry for error tracking
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Add E2E tests
