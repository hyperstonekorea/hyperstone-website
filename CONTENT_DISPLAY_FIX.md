# Content Display Fix Summary

## Issue
The website was showing only a test message instead of the actual content sections (Hero, About, Products, Contact).

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Page Update (`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`)
- Changed from server component to client component using `'use client'`
- Imported all section components (HeroSection, AboutSection, ProductsSection, ContactSection)
- Updated to use `useParams()` hook to get locale instead of async params

### 2. SSR Fixes for Hooks

#### `src/hooks/useBackgroundConfig.ts`
- Added SSR checks to prevent API calls during server-side rendering
- Modified `fetchConfig` to skip fetch when `typeof window === 'undefined'`
- Updated `useEffect` to only run on client side
- Applied same fixes to `useAllBackgroundConfigs`

#### `src/hooks/useOptimizedAnimation.ts`
- Added SSR-safe initialization for state variables
- Added check for `typeof window === 'undefined'` before accessing window APIs
- Added mobile-specific animation variants

#### `src/components/ui/OptimizedImage.tsx`
- Fixed `generateBlurDataURL` function to only run on client side
- Added check for `typeof window === 'undefined'` before creating canvas

### 3. Product Images Update (`src/data/products.ts`)
- Replaced local image paths with placeholder URLs from placehold.co
- Updated all 4 products to use external placeholder images
- Colors match brand palette (#0082FB, #0064E0, #1C2B33)

### 4. Next.js Config Update (`next.config.ts`)
- Added `placehold.co` to allowed image domains
- Added remote pattern for placehold.co

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- All content sections are imported and rendered
- SSR issues in hooks are fixed
- Product images use external placeholders
- Code is committed and pushed to GitHub

### ⚠️ Build Error Still Occurring
The build is still failing with a prerender error:
```
Error occurred prerendering page "/ko"
```

This error is happening in the compiled chunks, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. The error digest changes with each build, suggesting it might be related to:
1. Framer Motion animations during SSR
2. Intersection Observer in AnimatedSection
3. Some other client-side API being called during build

## Next Steps to Fix Build Error

### Option 1: Disable Static Generation for Dynamic Pages
Add to `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`:
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

### Option 2: Simplify Components Temporarily
Remove complex animations and dynamic backgrounds to isolate the issue:
1. Test with just HeroSection
2. Add sections one by one to find the problematic component
3. Simplify that component's animations

### Option 3: Use Suspense Boundaries
Wrap sections in Suspense to handle client-side rendering better:
```typescript
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <HeroSection locale={locale} />
</Suspense>
```

### Option 4: Check Framer Motion Configuration
The issue might be with Framer Motion's SSR handling. Consider:
1. Using `LazyMotion` for reduced bundle size
2. Disabling animations during SSR
3. Using simpler CSS animations instead

## Testing Locally

To test the current build:
```bash
cd hyperstone-website
npm run build
```

If successful, test the production build:
```bash
npm run start
```

## Deployment

Once the build succeeds:
1. Vercel will automatically deploy from the main branch
2. The website will be available at hyperstone.co.kr
3. All content sections will be visible

## Content Structure

The website now includes:
- **Hero Section**: Company branding, tagline, CTA buttons
- **About Section**: Vision, mission, core values, company stats
- **Products Section**: 4 DULITE products with cards and details
- **Contact Section**: Contact form, company info, map placeholder

All content is fully bilingual (Korean/English) and responsive.
