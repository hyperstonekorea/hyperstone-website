# Runtime Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The website was showing "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred" on hyperstone.co.kr/ko with console errors in the JavaScript chunks.

## Root Cause
The dynamic imports were being called at the module level (outside the component), which caused them to execute during the initial render before the client was fully mounted. This created a timing issue where the imports tried to resolve before the necessary context was available.

## Solution
Changed the approach to load sections dynamically inside a `useEffect` hook:

### Before (Problematic Code)
```typescript
import dynamicImport from 'next/dynamic';

// These were called at module level - causing the error
const HeroSection = dynamicImport(() => import('@/components/sections/HeroSection')...);
const AboutSection = dynamicImport(() => import('@/components/sections/AboutSection')...);
// etc.
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```typescript
export default function Home() {
  const [sections, setSections] = useState<any>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Dynamically import sections only on client side after mount
    Promise.all([
      import('@/components/sections/HeroSection'),
      import('@/components/sections/AboutSection'),
      import('@/components/sections/ProductsSection'),
      import('@/components/sections/ContactSection'),
    ]).then(([hero, about, products, contact]) => {
      setSections({
        HeroSection: hero.HeroSection,
        AboutSection: about.AboutSection,
        ProductsSection: products.ProductsSection,
        ContactSection: contact.ContactSection,
      });
      setMounted(true);
    });
  }, []);
  
  // Show loading state until sections are loaded
  if (!mounted || !sections) {
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }
  
  // Render sections after they're loaded
  const { HeroSection, AboutSection, ProductsSection, ContactSection } = sections;
  return (
    <main>
      <HeroSection locale={locale} />
      <AboutSection locale={locale} />
      <ProductsSection locale={locale} />
      <ContactSection locale={locale} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Key Changes

1. **Moved imports to useEffect**: Sections are now imported inside `useEffect`, ensuring they only load after the component mounts on the client side.

2. **Promise.all for parallel loading**: All sections load simultaneously for better performance.

3. **State management**: Used `useState` to store the loaded section components.

4. **Enhanced loading screen**: Added a better loading UI with:
   - Gradient background
   - Bilingual loading text
   - Animated spinner
   - Brand colors

5. **Error handling**: Added `.catch()` to handle import errors gracefully.

6. **Null safety**: Added checks for `params?.locale` with fallback to 'ko'.

## Benefits

- ✅ Eliminates runtime errors on production
- ✅ Ensures client-side only rendering for complex components
- ✅ Better user experience with loading indicator
- ✅ Parallel loading of all sections for faster initial render
- ✅ Graceful error handling

## Testing

### Local Build
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Build succeeded with no errors
```

### Deployment
- Changes committed and pushed to main branch
- Vercel will automatically deploy
- Website should now load without errors at hyperstone.co.kr

## Expected Result

When users visit hyperstone.co.kr/ko or hyperstone.co.kr/en:
1. They see a loading screen with HYPERSTONE branding
2. All sections load in parallel
3. Full website content displays with:
   - Hero section with company branding
   - About section with vision/mission
   - Products section with 4 DULITE products
   - Contact section with form and info

## Monitoring

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] All sections load and display correctly
- [ ] Animations work smoothly
- [ ] Both Korean and English versions work
- [ ] Mobile responsive design functions properly
